```sh
npm install omit --save-dev
```

```js
import EllipsisText from 'ellipsis-text'
new EllipsisText(dom, {
  str:
    'Fame,wealth and knowledge are merely worldly possessions that are withinthe reach of anybodyFame,wealth and knowledge are merely worldly possessions that are withinthe reach of anybodyFame',
  callback:function(res){
      console.log(res) 
      // output:Fame,wealth and knowledge are merely worldly possessions that are withinthe reach of anybodyFame,wealth and knowled
  }

## EllipsisText API

```js
new EllipsisText(
  HTMLElement,
{
  str: String,
  rows: Number,
  callback:function(res){}
})

## Tips

EllipsisText used canvas to determine the number of lines to be intercepted

If you pass in HTML, it deletes the nodes one by one to find the last text node that exceeds the height
